  Nowadays, front-end development is really messy. It's messy in these ways:
  
  1 there is no 'standard' way to develop a web applicatoin / mobile app
    --> there are always too many different tools and frameworks to choose from
    --> based on different combination of tools / frameworks, we have to manually setup a build-chain(workflow) to compile source code
    --> and it's not so easy to combine different tools, frameworks and building tools, because there are too many of them, and too 
    many versions of them too
  
  2 the tool set are not stable, and it cost lots of time to search in the darkness
    --> webpack is poorly documented
    --> lots of plugins, loaders are poorly documented, poorly implemented, or simply does not work
  
  3 the technology being used is changing too fast
    --> some library or tool was developed in jquery fashion, and now we have to transform it into es6 fashion, and we have to make it
    work with webpack too(think about those plugins and different versions of them)
