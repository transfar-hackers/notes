#how to handle a front-end project

##experience based on *b2b-online-shopping-mall* front-end project

#before start

##developping environment
1. choose an OS, Linux and MacOS preferred
2. choose a proper IDE, Sublime Text 3 and Visual Studio Code preferred
3. choose a version control tool, git + GitHub preferred
4. choose an HTTP forwarding / proxy tool, nginx preferred

##setup developing environment
5. it's better to have a *strict* restriction before-hand, this saves time and efforts
6. *restrictions* includes:
  *IDE used
  *IDE plugins used and settings
  *IDE configurations applied
  *Code styles(indents, tabs, wraps, blanks, functions, variables, statements...), ESLint
  recommended
7. HTTP forwarding / proxy tool --> for cros-domain-request and more
  * install and setup nginx
  * server blocks
  * server names
  * proxy_pass
  * /etc/hosts
8. make sure all team members have understood the setups, write down special settings 
when necessary

##based on the scenario and business requirements, setup developing framework
9. if we have to create our own framework, make sure every team member understands the source codes.
**IMPORTANT: outline coding styles and make sure every team member understands it and rely on it**
10. if we use existing frameworks, we should apply *best practise* of it, frameworks usually have a
*best practice* section
